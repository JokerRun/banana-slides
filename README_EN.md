## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this predicament: the presentation is due tomorrow, but the slides are still blank; your mind is full of brilliant ideas, but all your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design work?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Only preset templates can be selected, with no flexibility to adjust styles.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult to execute.
- 3️⃣ Finished products look similar, suffering from severe homogenization.
- 4️⃣ Asset quality is low and lacks relevance.
- 5️⃣ Disjointed text-image layouts with poor design aesthetics.

These flaws make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our two major needs: "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my eyes, far from having enough "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana 🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro to generate PPT pages and found that the results were excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompts while strictly following the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate beautiful PPTs with zero barrier to entry and no design experience required, reducing the hassle of template selection.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Refer to AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and visual elements to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete presentation assignments, focusing energy on content rather than layout and aesthetics.
5. **Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions with fast adaptation across multiple scenarios.

## 🎯 Features

### 1. Flexible and Diverse Creative Paths

Supports three starting methods—**Idea**, **Outline**, and **Page Description**—to cater to different creative workflows.
- **One-Sentence Generation**: Simply input a topic, and the AI will automatically generate a well-structured outline and page-by-page content descriptions.
- **Natural Language Editing**: Supports modifying outlines or descriptions via "Vibe" commands (e.g., "Change the third page to a case study"), with the AI responding and adjusting in real-time.
- **Outline/Description Modes**: Supports both one-click batch generation and manual refinement of details.
- **Layout Recommendations**: Page descriptions include ASCII Diagram layout recommendations to guide later page generation; these recommendations are not rendered as slide text.

<img width="2000" height="1125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fc1ecc6-433d-4157-b4ca-95fcebac66ba" />

### 2. Powerful Asset Parsing Capabilities

- **Multi-format Support**: Upload PDF/Docx/MD/Txt files, and the system automatically parses the content in the background.
- **Intelligent Extraction**: Automatically identifies key points, image links, and chart information from the text, providing rich materials for generation.
- **Style Reference**: Supports uploading reference images or templates to customize PPT styles.

### 3. "Vibe"-style Natural Language Modification

No longer restricted by complex menu buttons; issue modification commands directly via **natural language**.
- **Partial Redraw**: Make verbal-style modifications to specific areas (e.g., "Change this chart to a pie chart").
- **Full-page Optimization**: Generate high-definition pages with a consistent style based on nano banana pro🍌.

<img width="2000" height="1125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/929ba24a-996c-4f6d-9ec6-818be6b08ea3" />

### 4. PPT/PDF Translation and Restyle

- **Source-file translation**: Upload PPT/PPTX/PDF files; the backend converts them into page images and translates each page through image-to-image generation.
- **Target languages**: English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, Italian, and Arabic.
- **Two modes**: Pure translation keeps the original layout and visual elements; Translation + Restyle applies style references via uploaded images or `style_preset_id` (e.g. `ddi-standard`), using the backend canonical DDI base image and prompts from `/api/presets`.

### 5. Out-of-the-box Format Export

- **Multi-format Support**: One-click export to standard **PPTX** or **PDF** files.
- **Perfect Fit**: Default 16:9 aspect ratio; layout requires no manual adjustment, ready for direct presentation.

### 6. Fully Editable PPTX Export (Beta)

- **Export images as high-fidelity, clean-background PPT pages with freely editable images and text**
- For related updates, see https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121
- **If the editable PPT results are suboptimal (e.g., text overlapping, unstyled text), it is usually caused by configuration issues. Please refer to [Common Issues and Troubleshooting for Editable PPTX Export](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121#issuecomment-3708872527) for troubleshooting.**

## **🔧 FAQ**

1. **Garbled or blurry text on generated pages**
    - You can select a higher output resolution (the OpenAI format may not support increasing the resolution; Gemini format is recommended). According to tests, increasing the resolution from 1k to 2k before generating the page significantly improves text rendering quality.
    - Please ensure that the page description includes the specific text content you want to render.
    - `Layout Recommendation - ASCII Diagram` blocks in page descriptions are layout guidance only and are not rendered as slide body text.

2. **Poor results when exporting editable PPT, such as overlapping text or missing styles**
    - In 90% of cases, this is due to API configuration issues. You can refer to the troubleshooting and solutions in [issue 121](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121).

3. **Does it support free-tier Gemini API Keys?**
    - The free tier only supports text generation and does not support image generation.

4. **503 Error or Retry Error when generating content**
    - You can check the Docker backend logs using the commands provided in the README to locate the detailed error for the 503 issue. This is generally caused by incorrect model configuration.

5. **Why is the API Key not taking effect after setting it in .env?**
    - After editing `.env` during runtime, you must restart the Docker container to apply the changes.

6. **Where is the settings page? Why can't I find it?**
    - The current version uses env-only configuration mode, and the frontend settings page has been removed.
    - All global configuration must be changed via `.env` / deployment secrets, then applied by restarting the service.
